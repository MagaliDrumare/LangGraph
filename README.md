# LangGraph


### LangGraph  for cyclical graphs 
One of the things we highlighted in our LangChain v0.1 announcement was the introduction of a new library: LangGraph. LangGraph is built on top of LangChain and completely interoperable with the LangChain ecosystem. It adds new value primarily through the introduction of an easy way to create cyclical graphs. This is often useful when creating agent runtimes.
